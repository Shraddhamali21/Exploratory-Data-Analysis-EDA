📅Project Overview: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Weather Dataset📅

For this project, I ventured into the intricate world of meteorological variables, exploring vital data points including Ozone levels, Solar Radiation, Wind speed, Temperature, and categorical descriptors like Weather conditions, Month, Day, and Year.

Steps Undertaken:

🔍 Data Structure Examination:
Delved deep into the dataset's structure, deciphering its composition and dimensions.

📊 Data Type Assessment and Conversion:
Ensured data type consistency and compatibility for accurate interpretation.

🔎 Handling Duplicates:
Identified and eliminated duplicates to maintain data integrity and reliability.

📑 Column Management:
Streamlined the dataset by dropping redundant columns and refining names for clarity.

📈 Outlier Detection:
Identified outliers using histograms and box plots, gaining insights into data distribution and anomalies.

📊 Descriptive Statistics:
Computed descriptive statistics to summarize key dataset characteristics.

🔍 Missing Value Handling:
Meticulously addressed missing values through mean imputation, minimizing their impact on subsequent analyses.

🔄 Categorical Value Imputation:
Imputed missing values in categorical columns with the most frequent value for robust analysis.

📉 Scatter Plot and Correlation Analysis:
Unveiled relationships between variables through scatter plots and correlation analyses.

🔄 Transformations:
Implemented transformations like dummy variables and data normalization for optimized dataset analysis.

This project highlights the power of EDA in unlocking actionable insights and informing data-driven decision-making.
